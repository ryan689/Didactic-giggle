'''
The program will first randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that 
number is. (In other words, the user needs to be able to input information.) If the user's guess is wrong, 
the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. The number is too high or too low.) 
If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear. 
You'll need functions to check if the user input is an actual number, to see the difference between the 
inputted number and the randomly generated numbers, and to then compare the numbers.

# 1) Randomly generate a number unknown to the user


# 2) User should guess what that number is


# 3) If guess is wrong, let them know too high / too low


# 4) If guess is correct, let them know
